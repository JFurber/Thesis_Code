# Analysis of Badger Movement - Thesis
Files for the analysis of GPS badger movement in relation to the Thesis by Jessica Furber.

Files include:
<ul>
  <li> Conversion of coordinates from Latitude/Longitude to Easting/Northing (and back) - <i>R coding</i> </li>
  <li> Interpolation of coordinates for correct format of data for extended dynamic mode decomposition - <i>Matlab</i> </li>
  <li> Code to estimate the diffusion: </li>
    <ol>
      <li> separetely or as one whole file - <i> Python </i> </li>
      <li> automatically splitting the file into year and month for each individual - <i> Python </i> </li>
    </ol>
  <li> Generation of metastable states via extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) - <i> Python </i> </li>
</ul>

You will also require to download the folder d3s from https://github.com/sklus/d3s in order to use the EDMD.py file.
